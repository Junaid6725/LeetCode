🚀 LeetCode C++ Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems — all implemented in C++ with a focus on clean code, readability, and optimized approaches.
Each file corresponds to a specific problem, named with its problem number + title, making navigation simple and beginner-friendly.

📂 Repository Structure
Every problem has its own dedicated file
Files follow the naming format: ProblemNumber-ProblemTitle.cpp
All solutions are standalone and can be compiled independently
Organized for easy revision and interview prep

🛠️ Technology Used
C++ (Modern C++ standards)
Standard Template Library (STL) for efficient and clean implementations

🎯 Purpose of This Repository
Strengthen DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) fundamentals
Improve logical and problem-solving skills
Build a personal reference for coding interviews
Track long-term learning consistency
Document growth as I work through LeetCode

📌 Topics Covered
This repo gradually covers major DSA patterns, including:
Arrays
Strings
Two Pointers
HashMaps / Hashing
Linked List
Stack & Queue
Binary Search
Sliding Window
Recursion & Backtracking
Trees & Graphs
Dynamic Programming
Sorting & Greedy Techniques

📝 Notes
There are often multiple valid ways to solve a problem.
These solutions represent my personal approaches, thought process, edge-case handling, and optimization journey.
This repo grows with me.
