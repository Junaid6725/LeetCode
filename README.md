<h1>🚀 LeetCode Solutions </h1>
<p>
  This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems — all implemented in C++ with a focus on clean code, readability, and optimized approaches.
Each file corresponds to a specific problem, named with its problem number + title, making navigation simple and beginner-friendly.
</p>

<h2>📂 Repository Structure</h2>
Every problem has its own dedicated file
Files follow the naming format: ProblemNumber-ProblemTitle.cpp
All solutions are standalone and can be compiled independently
Organized for easy revision and interview prep

<h2>🛠️ Technology Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>C++ (Modern C++ standards)</li>
  <li>Standard Template Library (STL) for efficient and clean implementations</li>
